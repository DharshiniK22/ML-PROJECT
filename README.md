# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection using CNN

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can help in the early diagnosis of plant diseases, which is vital for modern **precision agriculture**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Goal:** To classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased using image data.
- **Method:** Train a CNN on a labeled dataset of plant leaf images.
- **Frameworks Used:** Python, Scikit-learn
- **Outcome:** A trained model capable of detecting diseases across various plant species with high accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Model Highlights

- Implemented a CNN from scratch and optimized:
  - Layer architecture (Conv, MaxPooling, Dense)
  - Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax)
  - Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- Performed image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Used a **publicly available plant disease dataset** with images of healthy and diseased leaves.
- Includes multiple plant species and disease types.
- Common classes:
  - Apple Scab
  - Tomato Late Blight
  - Potato Early Blight
  - Healthy leaves, etc.
